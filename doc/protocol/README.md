# Development Protocols Overview

**Created**: 2025 08 20
**Last Updated**: 2025 09 25

## Critical Enhancement Notice

**Codestral 22b MCP Filesystem Access**: As of 2025-09-25, Codestral 22b has direct filesystem access to `/Users/williamwatson/Documents/GitHub/GTach` via LM Studio MCP interface, significantly enhancing integration capabilities and economic efficiency potential.

## Starting a Software Development Cycle

### Claude Desktop Conversation Initialization

When initiating any software development cycle with Claude Desktop, begin conversations with this systematic approach:

#### 1. Protocol Confirmation Request
```
At the start of each new conversation, check if a local "Model Context Protocol" (MCP) 'filesystem' server is running and that language model 'mistralai/codestral-22b' is loaded. Review and confirm that you understand all protocols at the start of each new conversation. Protocols are stored in /Users/williamwatson/Documents/GitHub/GTach/doc/protocol and in project knowledge.
```

#### 2. Orchestration Protocol Consultation
**Mandatory First Step**: Reference Protocol 015 (AI Orchestration Framework) to determine optimal AI tool selection for the proposed development task.

#### 3. Project Context Review
- Current iteration status and objectives
- Recent development progress from ai/synopses/
- Relevant technical constraints and requirements
- Cross-platform considerations (Mac development/Pi deployment)

#### 4. Task Classification
Apply Protocol 015 decision matrix to determine:
- **Class A (Codestral Primary)**: Pure algorithmic tasks for maximum cost savings
- **Class B (Sequential Coordination)**: Hybrid algorithmic-integration workflows
- **Class C (Claude Code Strategic)**: Complex integration requiring full project context

## Protocol Framework

The GTach project follows structured development protocols with **Protocol 015 serving as the prime directive** governing all AI coordination decisions.

### Prime Directive Protocol

| Protocol | Purpose | Status | Authority |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| [Protocol 15](Protocol_015_AI_Orchestration_Resource_Optimization_Framework.md) | **AI Orchestration and Resource Optimization** | **Active** | **Supreme** |

**Protocol 015 establishes supreme authority over all AI tool coordination, requiring mandatory consultation at software engineering cycle initiation to optimize Claude Pro usage through systematic Codestral 22b utilization.**

### Immediate Priority Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [Protocol 1](Protocol_001_Project_Structure_Standards.md) | Project structure and organization | Active |

| [Protocol 7](Protocol_007_Obsidian_Integration_Standards.md) | Obsidian vault integration | Active |
| [Protocol 9](Protocol_009_AI_Coordination_Knowledge_Management.md) | AI coordination and knowledge management | Active |

*_Protocol 4 operates under Protocol 015 orchestration authority with dramatically reduced strategic scope - majority of responsibilities transferred to enhanced Codestral_

### High Priority Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [Protocol 5](Protocol_005_GitHub_Desktop_Workflow_Integration.md) | Version control workflow | Active |
| [Protocol 8](Protocol_008_Logging_Debug_Standards.md) | Logging and debugging standards | Active |
| [Protocol 10](Protocol_010_Hardware_Documentation_Integration_Standards.md) | Hardware documentation standards | Active |
| [Protocol 11](Protocol_011_Enhanced_AI_Memory_Session_Management.md) | Enhanced AI memory and session management | Active |
| [Protocol 12](Protocol_012_Visual_Documentation_Standards.md) | Visual documentation standards | Active |
| [Protocol 13](Protocol_013_Release_Management_Documentation_Standards.md) | Release management standards | Active |
| [Protocol 14](Protocol_014_Claude_Desktop_Codestral_22b_Integration.md) | Codestral 22b integration | Active* |

*_Protocol 14 operates under Protocol 015 orchestration authority with enhanced implementation scope_

## AI Orchestration Framework

### Hierarchical AI Coordination System
The project implements a systematic AI orchestration framework with economic efficiency as the primary optimization target:

```
