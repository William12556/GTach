## Structured Prompt Management System

### Prompt Template Framework
All Claude Code prompts must follow a standardized template structure that scales with task complexity and ensures comprehensive context provision.

**Base Template Structure**:
```
ITERATION: [000]
TASK: [Brief Description]
CONTEXT: [Development Context and Background]
ISSUE DESCRIPTION: [Detailed Problem Statement]
SOLUTION STRATEGY: [High-Level Approach]
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: [Step-by-Step Implementation Details]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [Measurable Completion Requirements]
DEPENDENCIES: [Related Files, Protocols, or Previous Implementations]
```

### Complexity-Based Template Adaptation

#### Simple Tasks (Basic implementations, minor modifications)
**Prompt Structure**:
- ITERATION: Three-digit sequential number
- TASK: Single sentence description
- CONTEXT: Brief background (1-2 sentences)
- IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Direct implementation steps
- SUCCESS CRITERIA: Clear completion markers

#### Standard Tasks (Feature implementations, integration work)
**Prompt Structure**:
- Full template implementation with comprehensive sections
- Detailed solution strategy with multiple approaches considered
- Step-by-step implementation plan with validation points
- Comprehensive success criteria including testing requirements

#### Complex Tasks (Architecture changes, cross-platform implementations)
**Prompt Structure**:
- Extended template with additional sections for risk assessment
- Multiple solution strategies with comparative analysis
- Detailed implementation plan with rollback procedures
- Comprehensive testing and validation requirements
- Integration impact assessment and mitigation strategies

### Sequential Numbering Integration
Prompt identification must align with the project's iteration-based numbering system to ensure consistency and traceability across all development artifacts.

**Identification Format**: `Prompt_[iteration]_[task_sequence]_[brief_description]`

**Examples**:
- `Prompt_001_01_GPIO_Interface_Implementation`
- `Prompt_001_02_GPIO_Unit_Tests_Creation`
- `Prompt_002_01_Configuration_Management_Integration`

## Prompt Creation and Management Procedures

### Inline Prompt Creation Requirements
All Claude Code prompts must be created as inline code blocks within Claude Desktop responses rather than as separate artifacts. This approach ensures immediate availability, maintains conversation context, and facilitates prompt archiving procedures.

**Format Requirements**:
```
Claude Code Prompt - Iteration [number]:

[Complete structured prompt content formatted as plain text code block]
```

### Prompt Archiving System
Every Claude Code prompt must be systematically archived in the project's prompt management system to ensure traceability, reusability, and continuous improvement of prompt effectiveness.

**Archiving Procedure**:
1. Create prompt file in `doc/prompts/` directory using standard naming convention
2. Include complete prompt text with all context and requirements
3. Add metadata including creation date, iteration number, and task classification
4. Cross-reference related implementation files and documentation
5. Update prompt effectiveness tracking based on execution results
6. Archive AI coordination context in `ai/project_knowledge/` for future reference
7. Update conversation synopsis in `ai/synopses/` for iteration continuity

### Prompt Quality Standards
All prompts must meet comprehensive quality requirements to ensure effective task execution and minimize iteration cycles between Claude Desktop and Claude Code.

**Content Requirements**:
- Complete context provision including relevant file contents where necessary
- Clear and unambiguous task descriptions with specific deliverables
- Detailed success criteria that enable objective completion validation
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case consideration
- Thread safety requirements explicitly stated for concurrent operations

## Integration Workflow Procedures

### Development Task Initiation
Each development task follows a systematic workflow that ensures proper coordination between Claude Desktop strategic planning and Claude Code tactical implementation.

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Task Analysis**: Claude Desktop analyzes requirements and formulates implementation strategy using previous iteration synopses from `ai/synopses/`
2. **Prompt Creation**: Structured prompt created inline with comprehensive context including relevant AI knowledge base materials
3. **Prompt Archiving**: Prompt saved to project prompt management system and AI coordination materials updated
4. **Task Execution**: Claude Code executes implementation following prompt specifications
5. **Result Validation**: Claude Desktop reviews implementation for compliance and quality
6. **Integration Documentation**: Results documented per Protocol 3 standards
7. **AI Coordination Update**: Technical knowledge and workflow insights archived in AI coordination system

### Quality Assurance Integration
Quality assurance procedures must be integrated throughout the Claude Desktop and Claude Code workflow to ensure consistent code quality and adherence to project standards.

**QA Checkpoints**:
- Prompt quality validation before Claude Code execution
- Implementation review for adherence to prompt specifications
- Code quality assessment including thread safety and error handling
- Documentation completeness verification
- Cross-platform compatibility validation where applicable

### Error Handling and Iteration Management
When Claude Code implementation does not meet specifications or encounters errors, a systematic approach must be followed to resolve issues while maintaining project standards and documentation requirements.

**Error Resolution Procedure**:
1. **Issue Classification**: Determine if error is prompt clarity, implementation approach, or environmental
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Claude Desktop analyzes implementation gaps and prompt deficiencies
3. **Prompt Refinement**: Create refined prompt addressing identified issues
4. **Re-implementation**: Claude Code executes refined prompt with improved context
5. **Validation and Documentation**: Ensure resolution meets original requirements and update documentation

## Cross-Platform Development Integration

### Platform-Specific Prompt Considerations
Prompts must address cross-platform development requirements including conditional imports, platform detection, and environment-specific configurations to ensure seamless operation across Mac development and Raspberry Pi deployment environments.

**Platform Integration Requirements**:
- Explicit platform compatibility requirements in all prompts
- Conditional import strategies for platform-specific dependencies
- Configuration management integration for environment-specific settings
- Testing procedures that validate cross-platform functionality

### Configuration Management Prompt Integration
All prompts involving configuration or platform-specific functionality must integrate with the project's configuration management system to ensure consistent behavior across development and deployment environments.

**Configuration Integration Standards**:
- Reference to platform configuration structure in relevant prompts
- Explicit handling of platform detection and configuration loading
- Environment-specific testing requirements and validation procedures
- Error handling for configuration loading failures and platform detection issues

## Prompt Effectiveness Monitoring

### Success Metrics Tracking
The effectiveness of Claude Code prompts must be systematically tracked to identify areas for improvement and optimize the prompt creation process over time.

**Tracking Metrics**:
- First-pass success rate for prompt execution
- Number of refinement iterations required per task
- Code quality metrics for implementations from prompts
- Cross-platform compatibility success rates
- Documentation completeness scores

### Continuous Improvement Process
Regular analysis of prompt effectiveness data must inform improvements to prompt templates, content standards, and workflow procedures to enhance overall development efficiency.

**Improvement Procedures**:
- Monthly review of prompt success metrics and failure patterns
- Template refinement based on identified common issues
- Quality standard updates based on implementation results
- Workflow optimization based on efficiency analysis
