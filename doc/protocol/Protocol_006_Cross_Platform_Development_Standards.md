## Configuration Management System

### Platform Detection and Configuration Loading
The system implements sophisticated platform detection and configuration management that supports seamless operation across development and deployment environments without manual intervention.

**Configuration Architecture**:
```json
{
  "common": {
    "application_name": "GTach",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "logging_level": "INFO"
  },
  "mac": {
    "gpio_mock": true,
    "development_mode": true,
    "test_data_path": "src/tests/data"
  },
  "pi": {
    "gpio_hardware": true,
    "production_mode": true,
    "hardware_config_path": "/etc/gtach"
  }
}
```

**Configuration Loading Strategy**:
- Automatic platform detection using system information and environment variables
- Hierarchical configuration loading with common settings overridden by platform-specific values
- Environment-specific path resolution and resource management
- Configuration validation and error handling for missing or invalid settings
- Runtime configuration updates and hot-reloading capabilities where appropriate

### Platform-Specific Implementation Management
Platform-specific functionality must be implemented using standardized patterns that enable code reuse while providing platform-optimized implementations.

**Implementation Patterns**:
- Factory pattern for platform-specific component instantiation
- Strategy pattern for platform-specific algorithm implementations
- Adapter pattern for platform-specific API integration
- Configuration-driven conditional behavior implementation
- Dependency injection for platform-specific service implementations

## Session-Based Logging Framework

### Timestamp-Based Log Management
The logging system implements session-based logging with timestamp-based file management that provides comprehensive audit trails while managing storage requirements efficiently.

**Logging Architecture**:
- Session-based log file creation with timestamp identification
- Hierarchical logging levels with platform-specific configuration
- Automatic log rotation and archival management
- Crash protection with automatic log file recovery
- Cross-platform log file format compatibility

**Log File Management**:
```
logs/
├── session_20250106_143022.log    # Current session log
├── session_20250106_102845.log    # Previous session log
├── archived/                      # Automatically archived logs
│   ├── 2025/01/05/               # Date-based archival
│   └── 2025/01/04/
└── crash_recovery.log             # Emergency crash information
```
