# Protocol 3 Amendment 001: Diagram Architecture Standards

**Created**: 2025 08 08

## Amendment Header

**Amendment ID**: Protocol_003_Amendment_001
**Parent Protocol**: Protocol 3 (Documentation Standards)
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active
**Created**: 2025 08 08

## Purpose

Define hierarchical diagram architecture, classification standards, and directory organization to distinguish between master system diagrams and component subsystem diagrams while establishing clear linkage requirements and naming conventions.

## Diagram Classification Framework

### Master Diagrams
**Definition**: Project-wide architectural diagrams representing complete system views and serving as single source of truth for overall system design.

**Scope**: 
- Complete project data flow across all subsystems
- Overall system architecture and component relationships
- Cross-platform integration patterns
- High-level interface definitions

**Authority**: Master diagrams govern subsidiary component diagrams and establish architectural constraints for detailed implementations.

### Component Diagrams  
**Definition**: Subsystem-specific diagrams detailing internal architecture, workflows, and interfaces within defined functional domains.

**Scope**:
- Detailed subsystem internal architecture
- Component interaction patterns within domain
- Implementation-specific workflows
- Interface specifications for subsystem boundaries

**Authority**: Component diagrams must maintain consistency with master diagrams and reference master as authoritative source.

## Directory Structure Standards

```

### Subsystem Organization
- Component diagrams organized by functional domain matching `src/` directory structure
- Each subsystem maintains dedicated subdirectory within `components/`
- Cross-subsystem interactions documented in master diagrams

## Naming Convention Standards

### Master Diagram Naming
**Format**: `[system_scope].md`
**Examples**:
- `system_architecture.md`
- `data_flow.md` 
- `component_interaction.md`

### Component Diagram Naming
**Format**: `[component_function].md`
**Examples**:
- `package_creation.md`
- `interface_management.md`
- `rendering_pipeline.md`

### Design Document Integration
Component diagrams reference parent design documents using standard format:
**Format**: `Design_[iteration]_[component].md`

## Linkage and Reference Requirements

### Master to Component References
Master diagrams must:
- Identify all subsidiary component diagrams
- Define interface contracts between subsystems
- Establish architectural constraints for component implementations
- Provide authoritative definitions for cross-subsystem integration

### Component to Master References  
Component diagrams must:
- Reference governing master diagram as authoritative source
- Maintain consistency with master-defined interfaces
- Align internal architecture with master constraints
- Document subsystem boundaries defined in master

### Cross-Component References
Component diagrams may reference other components through:
- Master diagram mediation for interface definitions
- Direct reference for implementation coordination
- Shared interface documentation for common patterns

## Content and Quality Standards

### Master Diagram Requirements
- Complete system coverage with no architectural gaps
- Authoritative interface definitions for all subsystems
- Cross-platform integration specifications
- Technology stack and dependency definitions

### Component Diagram Requirements
- Detailed subsystem internal architecture
- Implementation-specific workflow documentation
- Interface contract compliance with master specifications
- Integration patterns with other components

### Documentation Standards
All diagrams must include:
- Mermaid diagram syntax for technical visualization
- Comprehensive textual description
- Interface specifications and data flow documentation
- Integration requirements and dependencies

## Integration with Existing Protocols

### Protocol 1 Integration
Diagram directory structure aligns with project structure standards while extending design documentation hierarchy.

### Protocol 3 Integration
Diagram standards extend documentation standards with specialized technical diagram requirements and cross-reference management.

### Protocol 4 Integration
Diagram creation integrated with Claude Desktop design responsibilities and Claude Code implementation coordination.

## Validation and Compliance

### Structural Validation
- Directory structure compliance with amendment standards
- Naming convention adherence for all diagram files
- Proper subsystem organization within components directory

### Content Validation  
- Master diagram completeness and authority verification
- Component diagram consistency with master specifications
- Cross-reference accuracy and maintenance

### Quality Assurance
- Technical accuracy of architectural representations
- Integration consistency across diagram hierarchy
- Implementation alignment with documented architecture

## Implementation Requirements

### Immediate Actions
1. Relocate existing diagrams to compliant directory structure
2. Rename diagrams following established naming conventions
3. Establish master diagrams for project-wide architectural views
4. Organize component diagrams by functional subsystem

### Integration Actions
1. Update design document templates to reference diagram standards
2. Integrate diagram requirements into iteration completion procedures
3. Establish diagram review procedures within quality assurance framework
