**Created**: 2025 09 25

## Protocol Header

**Protocol Number**: Protocol_015_AI_Orchestration_Resource_Optimization_Framework
**Version**: 1.1
**Status**: Active - Prime Directive
**Created**: 2025 09 25
**Last Updated**: 2025 09 25
**Authority Level**: Supreme - Supersedes all AI integration protocols

## Amendment Record

### Amendment 1.1 - Enhanced Codestral MCP Filesystem Access (2025-09-25)
**Critical Enhancement**: Codestral 22b now has direct filesystem access to `/Users/williamwatson/Documents/GitHub/GTach` via LM Studio MCP interface, fundamentally altering orchestration decision matrix and economic efficiency calculations.

## Purpose

Establish systematic AI tool orchestration that optimizes economic efficiency through strategic Codestral 22b utilization while maintaining code quality and project integration standards. This protocol serves as the prime directive for all AI coordination decisions, requiring mandatory consultation at software engineering cycle initiation.

## Prime Directive Framework

### Supreme Authority Declaration
This protocol establishes supreme authority over all AI tool coordination decisions, superseding and coordinating existing AI integration protocols including Protocol 4 and Protocol 14. All software engineering cycles must initiate with mandatory consultation of this orchestration framework.

### Primary Optimization Target
**Economic Efficiency Mandate**: Minimize Claude Pro usage through systematic Codestral 22b utilization while maintaining professional code quality and project integration standards.

### Hierarchical Authority Model

```python
# Updated thresholds reflecting MCP filesystem access
integration_complexity_threshold = 0.5  # Raised from 0.3
project_context_available = True        # MCP filesystem access
protocol_compliance_capability = True   # Direct protocol access
multi_file_coordination_capability = True # Enhanced integration scope
