## Design Summary

**Design ID**: Design_004_Archive_Parallelization
**Date**: 2025 08 07
**Author**: GTach Development Team
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

### Purpose
Implement parallel file processing in ArchiveManager to improve performance for large archive operations through concurrent processing while maintaining thread safety and API compatibility.

### Scope
- ArchiveManager class modifications for parallel operations
- Thread pool configuration and management
- Performance measurement and benchmarking
- Cross-platform thread safety compliance

### Goals and Objectives
- Achieve 2-4x performance improvement for archives with >100 files
- Maintain 100% backward API compatibility
- Preserve thread safety per Protocol 8 standards
- Add configurable parallelization controls

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Parallel file collection and filtering operations
- **FR-2**: Concurrent checksum calculation for multiple files
- **FR-3**: Parallel file extraction where filesystem-safe
- **FR-4**: Configurable thread pool size (default: 4 threads)
- **FR-5**: Performance measurement and statistics reporting

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: 2-4x improvement for large archive operations
- **Reliability**: Zero regression in existing functionality
- **Maintainability**: Clean thread pool lifecycle management
- **Cross-Platform**: Mac development and Pi deployment compatibility

### Constraints
- **Technical**: Must use Python standard library concurrent.futures
- **Platform**: Thread safety across macOS and Linux platforms
- **Resource**: Memory usage must not increase significantly

## Architecture Design

### System Overview
Add ThreadPoolExecutor-based parallelization layer to existing ArchiveManager while preserving sequential archive I/O operations for integrity.

### Component Architecture
```
ArchiveManager
├── ThreadPoolExecutor (new)
│   ├── Parallel file collection
│   ├── Concurrent checksum calculation
│   └── Batch file processing
├── Archive I/O (sequential - unchanged)
│   ├── Tar creation/extraction
│   └── ZIP creation/extraction
└── Progress reporting (synchronized)
```

### Interface Design
- **Public Interfaces**: No changes to existing ArchiveManager API
- **Internal Interfaces**: New thread pool management methods
- **Configuration**: Extended ArchiveConfig with thread pool settings

### Data Flow
1. File discovery → Parallel filtering → Batch collection
2. Archive creation → Parallel preparation → Sequential writing
3. Archive extraction → Sequential reading → Parallel processing
