### Architecture Layers

#### Layer 1: Development Environment (Mac Mini M4)
**Package Creation Subsystem**: Automated package generation with source archival, configuration templating, dependency analysis, and integrity validation.

**Version Management**: SemVer-compliant versioning with parsing, compatibility checking, and dependency resolution.

**Repository Management**: Local package storage with metadata indexing, search capabilities, and distribution coordination.

#### Layer 2: Distribution Layer
**Distribution Management**: Secure package transfer with integrity verification and cross-platform protocol handling.

#### Layer 3: Deployment Environment (Raspberry Pi)
**Installation Subsystem**: Platform detection, dependency resolution, application deployment, and system integration.

**Update Management**: Staged update processing with validation and automatic rollback capabilities.

**Hardware Validation**: GPIO interface testing and hardware integration validation per Protocol 10 specifications.

### Data Flow Patterns

#### Primary Flow: Package Creation → Repository → Distribution → Installation
1. Source code collection and configuration processing
2. Version assignment and dependency analysis
3. Package integrity validation and repository storage
4. Secure distribution to target environment
5. Platform detection and dependency resolution
6. Application deployment and system integration
7. Hardware interface validation and operational verification

#### Secondary Flow: Update Management with Rollback Safety
1. Version compatibility assessment
2. Staged update preparation
3. Installation validation and testing
4. Hardware interface verification
5. Automatic rollback on failure detection

## Cross-Platform Specifications

### Development Environment Authority
**Mac Mini M4 Responsibilities**: Package creation, version management, repository operations, and distribution initiation using mock hardware interfaces for validation.

**Development Tools Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Desktop workflow coordination, Claude Code implementation execution, and GitHub Desktop version control per established protocols.

### Deployment Environment Authority
**Raspberry Pi Responsibilities**: Package installation, dependency resolution, hardware interface configuration, and operational validation using actual GPIO interfaces per Protocol 10 specifications.

**Production Configuration**: Platform-specific dependency resolution, hardware interface validation, and system service integration for embedded environment operation.

### Platform Abstraction Definition
**Configuration Management**: JSON-based platform detection with environment-specific configuration loading and cross-platform compatibility validation.

**Hardware Abstraction**: Mock implementations for Mac development with real hardware interfaces for Pi deployment, maintaining identical API contracts across platforms.
