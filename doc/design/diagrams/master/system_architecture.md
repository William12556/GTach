**Master Diagram ID**: Master_System_Architecture_GTach
**Category**: System Architecture
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025 08 08
**Last Updated**: 2025 08 08
**Authority Level**: Master Document - Single Source of Truth

## Purpose and Authority

### Master Document Purpose
This master document serves as the authoritative single source of truth for the GTach system architecture, defining the complete system structure, functional domain organization, cross-platform abstraction layers, and high-level integration patterns that govern all subsidiary architectural documentation.

### Scope of Authority
This master document definitively governs:
- Overall system structure and functional domain boundaries
- Cross-platform development and deployment architecture
- High-level component relationships and integration patterns
- System-wide architectural principles and design constraints
- Authoritative reference for all subsidiary architecture diagrams

### Subsidiary Document Coordination
All subsidiary architecture diagrams must maintain consistency with this master document and reference this document as their authoritative source for system-level architectural decisions and component relationships.

## System Overview

### Master System View
[To be developed: Highest level view of the GTach system showing functional domains, cross-platform abstractions, and deployment architecture]

### Architectural Principles
[To be developed: Core architectural principles including cross-platform compatibility, embedded systems constraints, and development workflow integration]

### Integration Points
[To be developed: Critical integration points between functional domains, platform abstraction layers, and hardware interfaces]
