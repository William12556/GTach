## System Overview

### Master Provisioning Architecture
The GTach provisioning system implements a comprehensive package management architecture enabling reliable deployment from Mac development environments to Raspberry Pi production targets through automated package creation, semantic versioning, repository management, and safe update procedures.

### Architectural Principles
- **Reliability**: Automated deployment with comprehensive validation and rollback capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Seamless Mac development to Pi production workflows
- **Version Management**: SemVer-compliant versioning with dependency resolution
- **Safety**: Staged updates with automatic rollback on failure
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing project protocols and workflows

### Integration Points
- Development workflow integration through Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- Version control coordination with GitHub Desktop per Protocol 5
