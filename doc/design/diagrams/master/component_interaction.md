**Authority Level**: Master Document - Single Source of Truth

## Purpose and Authority

### Master Document Purpose
This master document serves as the authoritative single source of truth for GTach component interactions, defining all component interfaces, data flow patterns, integration contracts, and communication protocols that govern subsidiary component interaction documentation.

### Scope of Authority
This master document definitively governs:
- Component interface specifications and contracts between all system components
- Data flow patterns and communication protocols across functional domains
- Integration requirements and dependency relationships throughout the system
- API specifications and interface contracts for cross-platform compatibility
- Authoritative reference for all subsidiary component interaction diagrams

### Subsidiary Document Coordination
All subsidiary component interaction diagrams must maintain consistency with this master document and reference this document for authoritative component interface specifications and interaction patterns.

## System Overview

### Master System View
[To be developed: Comprehensive view of component interactions across the GTach system including display, communication, core, and utility components]

### Architectural Principles
[To be developed: Core principles governing component interaction design including separation of concerns, interface consistency, and cross-platform compatibility]

### Integration Points
[To be developed: Critical component integration boundaries and communication protocols between functional domains]
