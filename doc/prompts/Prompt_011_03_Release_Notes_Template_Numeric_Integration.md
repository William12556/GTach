# Claude Code Prompt Documentation: Release Notes Template Numeric Integration

**Created**: 2025 08 17

## Prompt Documentation Header

**Prompt ID**: Prompt_011_03_Release_Notes_Template_Numeric_Integration
**Iteration**: 011
**Task Sequence**: 03
**Complexity**: Standard
**Priority**: High
**Change Reference**: Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System

## Context and Background

This prompt implements the third phase of Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System by comprehensively updating Template_Release_Notes.md to eliminate alphabetic version references and establish numeric version formatting throughout all template sections and examples. The modification ensures that all future release documentation adheres to the new numeric version numbering convention while maintaining professional presentation standards.

The Template_Release_Notes.md file serves as the foundational template for all release documentation creation throughout the project lifecycle. The comprehensive revision eliminates traditional alphabetic suffixes such as alpha, beta, and release candidate designations while establishing clear examples that demonstrate proper implementation of the structured numeric approach across all release maturity categories.

## Technical Requirements

The implementation requires systematic replacement of all alphabetic version examples with corresponding numeric format equivalents throughout the release notes template structure. Version consistency requirements must be updated to reflect numeric formatting standards while maintaining comprehensive coverage of all template sections and subsections.

File naming convention examples must be modified to demonstrate proper numeric version formatting in release documentation file names. All section examples must employ numeric version formatting to establish consistent implementation patterns for future release documentation creation activities.

## Implementation Objectives

The primary objective involves establishing comprehensive numeric version formatting examples throughout the template that demonstrate proper implementation of development iterations using 0XX format, alpha releases using 1XX format, beta releases using 2XX format, release candidates using 3XX format, and production releases using standard three-digit semantic versioning format.

Template structure preservation ensures continued functionality while implementing numeric version standards throughout all sections. Professional presentation standards must be maintained throughout the modification process to ensure continued effectiveness of the template for release documentation creation activities.

## Success Validation

Successful implementation requires complete elimination of alphabetic version suffix references throughout Template_Release_Notes.md while maintaining template structure and professional presentation quality. All version examples must demonstrate proper numeric formatting according to Change_011 specifications with comprehensive coverage of all release maturity categories.

File naming conventions must reflect numeric version formatting standards while template functionality remains intact for future release documentation creation. Professional presentation must be preserved throughout all template modifications to ensure continued effectiveness for stakeholder communication and project documentation requirements.

## Claude Code Prompt

```
ITERATION: 011
TASK: Release Notes Template Numeric Version Integration
CONTEXT: Implementation of numeric version numbering system requiring comprehensive updates to Template_Release_Notes.md to eliminate alphabetic version references and implement numeric version formatting throughout all template sections and examples.

PROTOCOL ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED:
- Read and understand ALL relevant project protocols from doc/protocol/
- Read and understand ALL relevant templates from doc/templates/
- Confirm protocol and template comprehension before beginning implementation
- Apply protocol requirements and template standards throughout development process
- Document any protocol or template conflicts or clarifications needed

FILE PLACEMENT REQUIREMENT:
- ALL SOURCE CODE FILES MUST BE CREATED IN src/ DIRECTORY
- NO PYTHON FILES (.py) IN PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY
- ALL TEST FILES MUST BE IN src/tests/ DIRECTORY

FILE MODIFICATION REQUIREMENT:
- MODIFY EXISTING FILES DIRECTLY - DO NOT CREATE NEW VERSIONS
- USE EXISTING FILENAME - NO _enhanced, _v2, _updated SUFFIXES
- VERSION CONTROL HANDLED BY GIT - NO MANUAL FILE VERSIONING
- PRESERVE ORIGINAL FILE PATHS AND NAMES

ISSUE DESCRIPTION: Template_Release_Notes.md contains multiple version formatting examples that employ alphabetic suffixes such as "alpha," "beta," and "rc" which must be replaced with numeric equivalents according to the new version numbering system. The template requires comprehensive revision to demonstrate proper numeric version formatting throughout all sections.

SOLUTION STRATEGY: Systematic replacement of all alphabetic version examples with numeric equivalents throughout the release notes template. Implementation of clear examples demonstrating the four-digit numeric versioning convention for development iterations, alpha releases, beta releases, release candidates, and production releases.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Review Template_Release_Notes.md to identify all version formatting examples and references
2. Replace alphabetic version examples with corresponding numeric format equivalents
3. Update version consistency requirements to reflect numeric formatting standards
4. Modify naming format examples to demonstrate proper numeric version file naming
5. Update all section examples to employ numeric version formatting throughout
6. Ensure template maintains professional presentation while implementing numeric conventions
7. Validate that all version references align with Change_011 specifications

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Template_Release_Notes.md contains no alphabetic version suffix references
- All version examples demonstrate proper numeric formatting according to Change_011 specifications
- File naming conventions updated to reflect numeric version formatting
- Template structure preserved while implementing numeric version standards
- Professional presentation maintained throughout template modifications

DEPENDENCIES: Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System provides technical specifications for numeric version formatting. Protocol 13 modifications establish the framework for template compliance requirements.
```

## Related Documentation

This prompt documentation coordinates with Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System for technical specifications and builds upon Protocol 13 modifications established in the previous implementation sequence. The template updates provide the standardized framework for all future release documentation creation throughout the project development lifecycle.

## Quality Assurance Notes

The prompt emphasizes preservation of template structure and professional presentation standards to ensure continued effectiveness for release documentation creation. Comprehensive coverage requirements ensure that all release maturity categories receive appropriate numeric version formatting examples within the template framework.
