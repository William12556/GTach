# Claude Code Prompt - Package Creator Root Detection Fix

**Created**: 2025 08 07

## Prompt Summary

**Prompt ID**: Prompt_002_03_Package_Creator_Root_Detection_Fix
**Task Type**: Bug Fix
**Complexity**: Standard
**Priority**: High

## Context

Project root auto-detection fails in test environments, resolving to temporary directories instead of actual GTach project root.

## Issue Description

PackageCreator auto-detection algorithm incorrectly identifies project root when instantiated from test temporary directories.

## Claude Code Prompt

```
ITERATION: 002
TASK: Fix Package Creator Project Root Auto-Detection  
CONTEXT: Auto-detection fails in test environment, resolving to temp directory instead of GTach project root.
PROTOCOL REVIEW REQUIRED:
- Review relevant project protocols from doc/protocol/
- Apply protocol requirements throughout implementation

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
PackageCreator auto-detection logic fails when instantiated from test temporary directories, incorrectly identifying temp paths as project root instead of actual GTach directory.

SOLUTION STRATEGY:
Enhance project root detection to handle test environments while maintaining production functionality.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Improve auto-detection algorithm in PackageCreator.__init__()
2. Add test environment compatibility
3. Maintain production environment functionality
4. Preserve existing explicit path specification

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- test_auto_detect_project_root passes
- Correct GTach project root detected from nested test directories
- Production functionality unaffected
- Explicit root specification continues working

DEPENDENCIES:
- src/provisioning/package_creator.py
- Test environment compatibility required
```

## Expected Outcome

Enhanced project root detection working in both test and production environments.

**Status**: Complete
**Result**: âœ… Success - Project root detection enhanced for test environments
