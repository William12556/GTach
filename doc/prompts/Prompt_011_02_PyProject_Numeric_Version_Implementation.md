# Claude Code Prompt Documentation: PyProject Numeric Version Implementation

**Created**: 2025 08 17

## Prompt Documentation Header

**Prompt ID**: Prompt_011_02_PyProject_Numeric_Version_Implementation
**Iteration**: 011
**Task Sequence**: 02
**Complexity**: Simple
**Priority**: High
**Change Reference**: Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System

## Context and Background

This prompt implements the second phase of Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System by modifying the pyproject.toml configuration file to establish the initial development version using the new four-digit numeric convention. The modification transitions the project from traditional semantic versioning format to the structured numeric approach that eliminates alphabetic suffixes while maintaining Python packaging compatibility.

The pyproject.toml file serves as the central configuration point for Python project metadata and build system specifications. The version field modification establishes the foundation for numeric version progression throughout the development cycle while ensuring compatibility with Python packaging standards and automated version processing systems.

## Technical Requirements

The implementation requires precise modification of the version field in pyproject.toml to implement the format 0.1.0.001 representing the first development iteration of version 0.1.0. The numeric version format must maintain compatibility with Python packaging standards while establishing the foundation for systematic version progression according to the new numbering convention.

Validation procedures must ensure that the modified version field maintains proper TOML syntax and formatting throughout the modification process. The version specification must align precisely with the numeric convention established in Change_011 to ensure consistency across all project components and documentation systems.

## Implementation Objectives

The primary objective involves updating the version field to implement the initial development iteration format while preserving Python packaging compatibility and TOML syntax requirements. The modification establishes the baseline for numeric version progression throughout subsequent development activities and release cycles.

Version specification alignment with Change_011 requirements ensures consistency across project documentation and configuration systems. The implementation provides the foundation for automated version processing capabilities that benefit from uniform numeric comparison algorithms and sorting functionality.

## Success Validation

Successful implementation requires the pyproject.toml version field to reflect the numeric format 0.1.0.001 with maintained compatibility with Python packaging standards. TOML syntax and formatting must be preserved throughout the modification process to ensure continued functionality of Python build and packaging systems.

Version specification alignment with Change_011 numeric convention requirements ensures consistency across project components. The modified version field must demonstrate proper integration with the established numeric version numbering system while maintaining all required configuration file functionality.

## Claude Code Prompt

```
ITERATION: 011
TASK: PyProject.toml Numeric Version Implementation
CONTEXT: Implementation of numeric version numbering system requiring modification of pyproject.toml to establish initial development version using the new four-digit numeric convention as specified in Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System.

PROTOCOL ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED:
- Read and understand ALL relevant project protocols from doc/protocol/
- Read and understand ALL relevant templates from doc/templates/
- Confirm protocol and template comprehension before beginning implementation
- Apply protocol requirements and template standards throughout development process
- Document any protocol or template conflicts or clarifications needed

FILE PLACEMENT REQUIREMENT:
- ALL SOURCE CODE FILES MUST BE CREATED IN src/ DIRECTORY
- NO PYTHON FILES (.py) IN PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY
- ALL TEST FILES MUST BE IN src/tests/ DIRECTORY

FILE MODIFICATION REQUIREMENT:
- MODIFY EXISTING FILES DIRECTLY - DO NOT CREATE NEW VERSIONS
- USE EXISTING FILENAME - NO _enhanced, _v2, _updated SUFFIXES
- VERSION CONTROL HANDLED BY GIT - NO MANUAL FILE VERSIONING
- PRESERVE ORIGINAL FILE PATHS AND NAMES

ISSUE DESCRIPTION: The pyproject.toml file currently employs traditional semantic versioning format that requires modification to implement the new numeric version numbering system. The version field must be updated to reflect the four-digit development iteration format while maintaining compatibility with Python packaging standards.

SOLUTION STRATEGY: Modification of the version field in pyproject.toml to implement the initial development version using format 0.1.0.001 representing the first development iteration of version 0.1.0. This establishes the foundation for numeric version progression throughout the development cycle.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Locate the version field in pyproject.toml configuration file
2. Update version value to implement initial development iteration format 0.1.0.001
3. Verify that the numeric version format maintains compatibility with Python packaging standards
4. Ensure that the version specification aligns with the numeric convention established in Change_011
5. Validate that the modified version field maintains proper TOML syntax and formatting

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- PyProject.toml version field updated to numeric format 0.1.0.001
- Version specification maintains compatibility with Python packaging standards
- TOML syntax and formatting preserved throughout modification
- Version specification aligns with Change_011 numeric convention requirements

DEPENDENCIES: Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System provides the technical specification for numeric version formatting. Protocol 13 modifications must be completed to ensure consistency across project documentation.
```

## Related Documentation

This prompt documentation coordinates with Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System for technical specifications and follows the implementation sequence established in the change plan. The modification establishes the configuration foundation for numeric version numbering throughout the project development lifecycle.

## Quality Assurance Notes

The prompt emphasizes Python packaging compatibility to ensure that the numeric version format functions properly with standard Python build and distribution systems. TOML syntax preservation requirements ensure continued functionality of project configuration management throughout the version numbering system transition.
