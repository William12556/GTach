# Claude Code Prompt Documentation: Protocol 13 Numeric Version Integration

**Created**: 2025 08 17

## Prompt Documentation Header

**Prompt ID**: Prompt_011_01_Protocol_13_Numeric_Version_Integration
**Iteration**: 011
**Task Sequence**: 01
**Complexity**: Standard
**Priority**: High
**Change Reference**: Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System

## Context and Background

This prompt implements the first phase of Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System by revising Protocol 13 Release Management Documentation Standards to eliminate alphabetic version suffixes and establish comprehensive numeric version numbering guidelines. The modification represents a systematic enhancement of version management procedures to support automated processing requirements while maintaining semantic versioning principles.

Protocol 13 currently contains multiple references to alphabetic version identifiers including alpha, beta, and release candidate designations that require replacement with the structured numeric convention. The revision establishes clear specifications for the four-digit version numbering system where the fourth digit position indicates release maturity through hundreds-based categorization.

## Technical Requirements

The implementation requires comprehensive revision of Protocol 13 documentation to reflect numeric version formatting throughout all sections and examples. Version consistency requirements must be updated to incorporate numeric format validation procedures. Release note content standards require modification to eliminate alphabetic version references while maintaining professional documentation quality.

Integration procedures with development workflows must be updated to support numeric version identification across all project components. Quality assurance standards require enhancement to include numeric version validation procedures that ensure consistency across project documentation and configuration systems.

## Implementation Objectives

The primary objective involves systematic replacement of alphabetic version examples with numeric equivalents that demonstrate proper implementation of the new version numbering convention. Clear guidelines must be established for development iterations using 0XX format, alpha releases using 1XX format, beta releases using 2XX format, release candidates using 3XX format, and production releases using standard three-digit semantic versioning format.

Version consistency requirements require comprehensive update to reflect numeric format specifications and establish validation procedures for maintaining consistency across project components. Template compliance requirements must be revised to ensure proper numeric version formatting throughout all release documentation materials.

## Success Validation

Successful implementation requires complete elimination of alphabetic version suffix references throughout Protocol 13 documentation. All version examples must demonstrate proper numeric formatting according to Change_011 specifications. Clear guidelines must be established for the four-digit numeric versioning convention with comprehensive coverage of all release maturity categories.

Version consistency requirements must reflect numeric format specifications with detailed validation procedures. Integration procedures must support numeric version identification across all development workflow components. Quality assurance standards must include comprehensive numeric version validation procedures that ensure project-wide consistency.

```
ITERATION: 011
TASK: Protocol 13 Numeric Version Numbering Integration
CONTEXT: Implementation of Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System requiring comprehensive revision of Protocol 13 Release Management Documentation Standards to eliminate alphabetic version suffixes and implement purely numeric version identification system.

PROTOCOL ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED:
- Read and understand ALL relevant project protocols from doc/protocol/
- Read and understand ALL relevant templates from doc/templates/
- Confirm protocol and template comprehension before beginning implementation
- Apply protocol requirements and template standards throughout development process
- Document any protocol or template conflicts or clarifications needed

FILE PLACEMENT REQUIREMENT:
- ALL SOURCE CODE FILES MUST BE CREATED IN src/ DIRECTORY
- NO PYTHON FILES (.py) IN PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY
- ALL TEST FILES MUST BE IN src/tests/ DIRECTORY

FILE MODIFICATION REQUIREMENT:
- MODIFY EXISTING FILES DIRECTLY - DO NOT CREATE NEW VERSIONS
- USE EXISTING FILENAME - NO _enhanced, _v2, _updated SUFFIXES
- VERSION CONTROL HANDLED BY GIT - NO MANUAL FILE VERSIONING
- PRESERVE ORIGINAL FILE PATHS AND NAMES

ISSUE DESCRIPTION: Protocol 13 Release Management Documentation Standards contains multiple references to alphabetic version suffixes including "alpha," "beta," and "rc" that must be replaced with numeric equivalents according to the new version numbering system. The protocol requires comprehensive revision to support the four-digit numeric versioning convention where the fourth digit indicates release maturity through hundreds positioning.

SOLUTION STRATEGY: Systematic replacement of all alphabetic version references with numeric equivalents throughout Protocol 13 documentation. Implementation of clear guidelines for the new numeric version system including development iterations (0XX), alpha releases (1XX), beta releases (2XX), release candidates (3XX), and production releases (standard three-digit format).

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Modify Protocol 13 header section to reflect version numbering system changes
2. Replace all alphabetic version examples with numeric equivalents throughout the document
3. Update version consistency requirements to reflect numeric format specifications
4. Revise release note content standards to eliminate alphabetic version references
5. Update template compliance requirements for numeric version formatting
6. Modify integration requirements with development workflow to support numeric versioning
7. Update quality assurance standards to include numeric version validation procedures

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Protocol 13 contains no references to alphabetic version suffixes
- All version examples demonstrate proper numeric formatting according to the new system
- Clear guidelines established for four-digit numeric versioning convention
- Version consistency requirements updated to reflect numeric format specifications
- Integration procedures updated to support numeric version identification

DEPENDENCIES: Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System provides the technical specification for the new numeric version numbering system. Template_Release_Notes will require corresponding updates following Protocol 13 modifications.
```

## Related Documentation

This prompt documentation coordinates with Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System for technical specifications and Protocol 4 Claude Desktop and Claude Code Integration for prompt management standards. The implementation establishes the foundation for subsequent template and configuration updates throughout the numeric version numbering system deployment.

## Quality Assurance Notes

The prompt includes comprehensive protocol acknowledgment requirements to ensure proper understanding of project standards before implementation begins. File modification requirements explicitly prevent creation of duplicate files while ensuring proper version control integration. Success criteria provide measurable completion requirements that enable objective validation of implementation effectiveness.
