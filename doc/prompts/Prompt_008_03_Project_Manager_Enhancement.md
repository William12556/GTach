# Claude Code Prompt: Enhanced Project Version Manager Integration

**Created**: 2025 08 14

**Prompt ID**: [008_03]
**Task Type**: Enhancement
**Complexity**: Standard
**Priority**: High

## Context

The ProjectVersionManager requires enhancement to integrate with the new VersionStateManager and provide improved consistency detection and resolution capabilities. This enhancement supports the package creation workflow by ensuring project files remain synchronized with the authoritative version state.

## Issue Description

Current ProjectVersionManager needs integration with VersionStateManager to:

1. Coordinate with persistent version state for consistency checking
2. Provide enhanced inconsistency resolution with user guidance
3. Support VersionStateManager updates during project file synchronization
4. Improve user prompts for consistency resolution
5. Maintain integration with existing atomic update mechanisms

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
ProjectVersionManager operates independently from persistent version state, leading to:
- Disconnect between `.gtach-version` state and project file versions
- Manual consistency resolution without state coordination
- No integration between project updates and version state management

### Impact Assessment
- **Functionality**: Enhanced consistency management with state coordination
- **Performance**: Minimal impact - adds version state synchronization calls
- **Compatibility**: Maintains existing ProjectVersionManager API
- **Dependencies**: Requires VersionStateManager for state coordination
