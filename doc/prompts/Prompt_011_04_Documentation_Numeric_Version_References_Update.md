**Created**: 2025 08 17

## Prompt Documentation Header

**Prompt ID**: Prompt_011_04_Documentation_Numeric_Version_References_Update
**Iteration**: 011
**Task Sequence**: 04
**Complexity**: Standard
**Priority**: Medium
**Change Reference**: Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System

## Context and Background

This prompt implements the final phase of Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System by conducting a comprehensive review and update of project documentation including README.md and other reference materials to ensure complete alignment with the new numeric version convention. The modification eliminates any remaining alphabetic version references throughout project documentation while establishing consistent numeric version formatting across all project materials.

Project documentation serves as the primary interface for stakeholder communication and project understanding. The comprehensive review ensures that all version numbering references maintain consistency with the established numeric convention while preserving professional presentation and technical accuracy throughout all documentation materials.

## Technical Requirements

The implementation requires systematic examination of all project documentation to identify version numbering references that require modification to align with the numeric convention. All identified version references must be updated to employ numeric formatting according to Change_011 specifications while maintaining documentation clarity and professional presentation standards.

Consistency validation across all documentation materials ensures uniform application of the numeric version numbering system throughout project components. Documentation updates must preserve professional presentation quality while implementing the systematic numeric approach across all reference materials and stakeholder communication documents.

## Implementation Objectives

The primary objective involves conducting comprehensive documentation review to identify and update version numbering references throughout all project materials. Consistent numeric version formatting must be established across README.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md, and any additional documentation containing version references or examples.

Professional presentation maintenance ensures continued effectiveness of project documentation for stakeholder communication and technical reference purposes. The implementation establishes complete consistency across all project documentation while preserving clarity and technical accuracy throughout all materials.

## Success Validation

Successful implementation requires all project documentation to employ consistent numeric version formatting throughout all references and examples. README.md must reflect the numeric version convention where applicable while maintaining its effectiveness for project overview and setup instruction purposes.

Documentation consistency across all materials ensures uniform application of the numeric version numbering system throughout project components. Professional presentation must be preserved throughout all modifications to maintain stakeholder communication effectiveness and technical documentation quality standards.

## Claude Code Prompt

```
ITERATION: 011
TASK: Project Documentation Numeric Version References Update
CONTEXT: Implementation of numeric version numbering system requiring updates to README.md and other project documentation to reflect the new numeric version convention and eliminate any remaining alphabetic version references throughout project documentation materials.

PROTOCOL ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED:
- Read and understand ALL relevant project protocols from doc/protocol/
- Read and understand ALL relevant templates from doc/templates/
- Confirm protocol and template comprehension before beginning implementation
- Apply protocol requirements and template standards throughout development process
- Document any protocol or template conflicts or clarifications needed

FILE PLACEMENT REQUIREMENT:
- ALL SOURCE CODE FILES MUST BE CREATED IN src/ DIRECTORY
- NO PYTHON FILES (.py) IN PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY
- ALL TEST FILES MUST BE IN src/tests/ DIRECTORY

FILE MODIFICATION REQUIREMENT:
- MODIFY EXISTING FILES DIRECTLY - DO NOT CREATE NEW VERSIONS
- USE EXISTING FILENAME - NO _enhanced, _v2, _updated SUFFIXES
- VERSION CONTROL HANDLED BY GIT - NO MANUAL FILE VERSIONING
- PRESERVE ORIGINAL FILE PATHS AND NAMES

ISSUE DESCRIPTION: Project documentation including README.md may contain version numbering references that require updates to align with the new numeric version convention. All documentation must be reviewed and modified to ensure consistency with the numeric version numbering system established in Change_011.

SOLUTION STRATEGY: Comprehensive review of project documentation to identify and update any version numbering references that require modification to align with the numeric convention. Implementation of consistent numeric version formatting throughout all project documentation materials.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Review README.md for any version numbering references requiring updates
2. Examine RELEASE_NOTES.md for consistency with numeric version formatting
3. Identify any other project documentation containing version references
4. Update all identified version references to employ numeric formatting
5. Ensure consistency across all documentation materials with Change_011 specifications
6. Validate that documentation updates maintain professional presentation and clarity
7. Confirm that all version references align with the established numeric convention

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All project documentation employs consistent numeric version formatting
- README.md updated to reflect numeric version convention where applicable
- RELEASE_NOTES.md demonstrates proper numeric version formatting
- Documentation maintains professional presentation throughout modifications
- Version references align consistently with Change_011 specifications

DEPENDENCIES: Change_011_Numeric_Version_Numbering_System establishes the technical framework for numeric version formatting. Protocol 13 and template modifications provide the standards for documentation consistency requirements.
