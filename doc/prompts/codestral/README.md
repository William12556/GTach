# Codestral 22b Prompt Documentation

**Created**: 2025 09 25

## Purpose

Contains Codestral 22b prompts following Protocol 14 standards for algorithmic implementation with MCP filesystem access, optimized for economic efficiency through enhanced local model utilization.

## Prompt Classification

### Economic Efficiency Categories

**Class A: Codestral Primary (95%+ cost reduction)**
- Pure algorithmic implementation with project context
- Protocol-compliant implementations with direct access
- Enhanced integration through MCP filesystem capabilities
- Mathematical computation and data processing logic

**Class B: Codestral-Claude Code Sequential (80-90% cost reduction)**
- Complex architectural implementations requiring strategic oversight
- Multi-protocol coordination requiring validation
- Advanced cross-platform implementations with deployment complexity

### Authority Framework
**Primary Authority**: Protocol 14 (Claude Desktop and Codestral 22b Integration)
**Orchestration Authority**: Protocol 015 (AI Orchestration and Resource Optimization)
**Enhanced Capabilities**: MCP filesystem access for direct project integration

## Naming Convention

**Format**: `Codestral_[iteration]_[sequence]_[description].md`

**Examples**:
- `Codestral_001_01_Algorithm_Optimization_Analysis.md`
- `Codestral_001_02_Performance_Critical_Implementation.md`
- `Codestral_002_01_Mathematical_Computation_Enhancement.md`

## Enhanced MCP Capabilities

### Filesystem Access Integration
**Critical Advantage**: Direct project filesystem access through LM Studio MCP interface enables:
- Real-time project structure analysis and navigation
- Existing code examination for integration planning
- Protocol and template compliance verification
- Configuration file analysis and platform detection integration
- Multi-file coordination with existing codebase awareness

### Advanced Integration Capabilities
- Direct file modification with project context understanding
- Cross-file dependency analysis and implementation
- Protocol-compliant implementation with direct protocol access
- Enhanced project integration without external validation requirements
