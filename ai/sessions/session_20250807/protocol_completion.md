# Session Decisions - Protocol Documentation Complete

**Decision**: All Protocol 2 Phase 1 documentation completed
**Status**: Ready for Claude Code implementation

## Phase 1 Deliverables Complete
- [x] Design_004_Archive_Parallelization.md - Created 2025-08-07
- [x] Change_004_Archive_Performance_Optimization.md - Created 2025-08-07  
- [x] Prompt_004_01_Archive_Parallelization_Implementation.md - Created 2025-08-07
- [x] All documents validated with correct timestamps

## Protocol Compliance Achieved
- Protocol 2: Phase 1 design and change documents created
- Protocol 4: Claude Code prompt properly archived with copyable format
- Protocol 3: Document timestamps verified accurate

## Implementation Ready
ThreadPoolExecutor-based archive parallelization with:
- Configurable thread pool (default: 4 threads)
- Thread-safe progress reporting
- 2-4x performance target for large archives
- Full API compatibility preservation

## Next Action
Execute Claude Code prompt for Phase 2 implementation.
