# Performance Analysis - Provisioning System Components

## Major Performance Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. I/O Operations
**PackageCreator**: Individual file copying in `_copy_files_to_workspace()`
**ArchiveManager**: Sequential file processing in compression loops
**UpdateManager**: Individual file extraction during updates
**PackageRepository**: Repeated file system operations for each package

### 2. Search Performance  
**PackageRepository**: O(n) sequential search through all packages in `search_packages()`
- No indexing by common search criteria (name, version, platform)
- No result caching for repeated searches

### 3. Repeated Computations
**Multiple Components**: Checksum calculations performed multiple times on same files
- PackageCreator: 4KB chunks
- ArchiveManager: 8KB chunks  
- UpdateManager: During validation
- PackageRepository: During storage

### 4. Memory Usage
**Archive Operations**: Large files loaded entirely into memory during processing
**JSON Operations**: Complete repository index loaded/saved each time

### 5. Sequential Processing
**All Components**: No parallelization of file operations
- Archive creation processes files one at a time
- File copying operations are sequential
- Checksum calculations are single-threaded

### 6. Directory Traversal
**File Collection**: Multiple components use `rglob('*')` which can be slow
- PackageCreator file collection
- ArchiveManager file discovery
- UpdateManager backup creation

## Optimization Targets (Priority Order)
1. **PackageRepository search performance** - Highest impact
2. **Archive creation/extraction parallelization** - High impact
3. **Checksum caching and optimization** - Medium-high impact  
4. **I/O operation batching** - Medium impact
5. **Memory usage optimization** - Medium impact
