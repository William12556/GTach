# Archive Parallelization Strategy - Iteration 004

**Optimization Target**: ArchiveManager parallel file operations

## Current Sequential Operations
- File collection and filtering
- Archive creation (tar/zip)
- File extraction
- Checksum calculations
- File copying

## Parallelization Approach

### 1. File Processing Pool
- Add configurable thread pool (default: 4 threads)
- Parallel file collection and filtering
- Batch processing for archive operations

### 2. Archive Creation Optimization
- Parallel file preparation (checksum, metadata)
- Sequential archive writing (maintain integrity)
- Progress reporting aggregation

### 3. Extraction Optimization
- Parallel file extraction where safe
- Maintain extraction order for dependencies
- Concurrent checksum validation

### 4. Thread Safety Considerations
- Archive file handles remain single-threaded
- File system operations use locks where needed
- Progress callbacks synchronized

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Thread Pool Infrastructure
- Add ThreadPoolExecutor configuration
- Implement batch processing utilities
- Add synchronized progress reporting

### Phase 2: Parallel File Operations
- Parallelize file collection/filtering
- Concurrent checksum calculations
- Batch file copying operations

### Phase 3: Archive Operation Optimization
- Parallel preparation, sequential writing
- Concurrent extraction validation
- Performance benchmarking

## Expected Performance Gains
- 2-4x improvement for large archives (>100 files)
- Reduced I/O wait time through concurrent operations
- Better CPU utilization on multi-core systems
