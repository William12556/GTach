### Decision Matrix Recalibration

#### Enhanced Thresholds
```python
# Previous thresholds
integration_complexity_threshold = 0.3
economic_efficiency_class_a = 0.90

# Enhanced thresholds with MCP filesystem access
integration_complexity_threshold = 0.5  # Raised due to enhanced capabilities
economic_efficiency_class_a = 0.95     # Improved through direct integration
project_context_available = True       # New capability
protocol_compliance_capability = True  # New capability
```

#### Expanded Task Coverage
- **Multi-file coordination**: Now Class A instead of Class C
- **Protocol compliance**: Automated through direct access
- **Project integration**: Direct capability without handoff
- **Configuration management**: Real-time platform detection
